# ResponderChain

`ResponderChain` is a library that passes events using the responder chain.

In Cocoa's development model, events can be delivered using `delegate`, `block`, and `notification`.
Usually a delegate or block is used to pass events between a `ViewController` and a `View`, However, when a deep nested `view` needs to pass events to the `ViewController`, using a delegate or block might require passing them layer by layer. Now, events can be passed in one step, regardless of how deep the view hierarchy is, using the `ResponderChain`.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager
[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is Apple's decentralized dependency manager to integrate libraries to your Swift projects. It is now fully integrated with Xcode 11

To integrate `ResponderChain` into your project using SPM, specify it in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    …
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/GodL/ResponderChain.git", from: "1.0.2"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "YourTarget", dependencies: ["ResponderChain", …])
        …
    ]
)
```

### Cocoapods

``` ruby
pod 'GLResponderChain', '~> 1.0.3'
```

## Usage

```swift
let rootView = UIView()

let subView = UIView()

let subSubView = UIView()

rootView.addSubview(subView)
subView.addSubview(subSubView)

```
### normal

```swift

rootView.rsp.register(key: “123”) { (value: String) -> Bool in
    XCTAssertEqual(value, "123")
    return false
}

subView.rsp.register(key: ”123) { (value: String) -> Bool in
    XCTAssertEqual(value, "123")
    return true
}

subSubView.rsp.handler(key: “123”, value: "123")
```

### type-safe

```swift

var key123: ResponderKey<String> = ResponderKey(value: "123")

rootView.rsp.register(typeKey: key123) { (value: String) -> Bool in
    XCTAssertEqual(value, "123")
    return false
}

subView.rsp.register(typeKey: key123) { (value: String) -> Bool in
    XCTAssertEqual(value, "123")
    return true
}

subSubView.rsp.handler(typeKey: key123, value: "123")
```
